## Part 1: SoC (Theory)

### What is Soc?

A System on a Chip (SoC) is like a small computer made on a single chip. All the functions are combined into 1 single chip instead of multiple chips. This makes Soc more power and space efficient . SoC are present on smartphones, smartwatches etc.

#### Key Parts of an SoC:

1. **CPU** : The brain of the SoC. It does most of the processing and handles all the instructions given to it.

2. **Memory** : 
   
   - **RAM** for temporary storage of data before you shutdown the device.
   
   - **ROM** for the storage of data even after the device is shutdown.

3- **Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)** Handles the visual and graphics processing.

4- **I/O Ports** used to connect to external device like cameras, USB.

5- **Digital Signal Processor**: Processes audio and video signal.

6- **Power Management** Regulates power usage in the SoC improving its efficiency.

7- **Special Features** : Additional modules like the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS etc. 

#### Why SoCs Are Awesome

- **Space Saving**: Smaller devices.
- **Energy Efficient**: Lower power consumption.
- **High Performance**: Faster data processing.
- **Cost Effective**: Cheaper to manufacture.
- **Reliable**: Fewer failure points.

#### Where Youâ€™ll Find SoCs

- Smartphones, tablets, wearables, IoT devices, cars, TVs.

#### Some Popular SoCs

- Apple A-Series, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Samsung Exynos, NVIDIA Tegra.

#### Challenges with SoCs

- Complex design, heat issues, less flexibility.
